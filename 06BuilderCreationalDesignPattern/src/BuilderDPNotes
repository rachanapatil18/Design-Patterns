Creational Design Pattern
1. Some objects are  simple and can be created in a single constructor call
2. Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create
3. having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive
4. Instead, opt for piecewise construction
5. Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step

Builder- When piecewise object construction is complicated provide and API for doing it succinctly
