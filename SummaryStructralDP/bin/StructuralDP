Factories-
Problems-
1. Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
2. Constructor is not descriptive
	1. Name mandated by name of containing type
	2. Cannot overload with same set of arguments with different names
	3. can turn into 'overloading hell'
3. Wholesale object creation(non- piecewise, unlike builder) can be outsourced to
	1. A separate function(Factory Method)
	2.That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
	3. Can create hierachy of factories with abstract factory
	
	What is Factory-
	A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects
